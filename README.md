Mojito is a continuous localization platform. Rely on continuous integration to collect all of your software strings in one place. Check what products need localization—in real time. Create and import translation packages—with a single click. Search and edit translations—across all products and languages! And if you have a small dedicated translation team, they can work directly in mojito.

### Features:
- Extract (push) strings from your repository to be translated
- Generates localized files from translated strings (pull)
- Includes quality checks of the translated content (placeholder validation, etc)
- Uses previous translations to support refactoring (basic leveraging - no fuzzy)
- Generates XLIFFs - files that translators know how to use
