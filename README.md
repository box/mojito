Mojito is an automation platform that enables continuous localization.  It fits naturally into various continous integration pipeline, has a simple workbench and a powerful command line to translating, pushing and pulling translated strings.

### Features:
- Extract (push) strings from your repository to be translated
- Generates localized files from translated strings (pull)
- Includes quality checks of the translated content (placeholder validation, etc)
- Uses previous translations to support refactoring (basic leveraging - no fuzzy)
- Generates XLIFFs - files that translators know how to use
