# Mojito 

Mojito is a continuous localization platform. Rely on continuous integration to collect all of your software strings in one place. Check what products need localization in real time. Create and import translation packages with a single click. Search and edit translations across all products and languages! And if you have a small dedicated translation team, they can work directly in mojito.

### Features:
- Extract (push) strings from your repository to be translated
- Generates localized files from translated strings (pull)
- Includes quality checks of the translated content (placeholder validation, etc)
- Uses previous translations to support refactoring (basic leveraging - no fuzzy)
- Generates XLIFFs - files that translators know how to use
