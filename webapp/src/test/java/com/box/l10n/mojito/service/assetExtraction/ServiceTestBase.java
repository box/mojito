/**
 * Base class for testing services, compared to {@link WSTestBase} the in-memory
 * http server shouldn't be started.
 *
 * <p>
 * TODO(P1) Review test issue
 *
 * For now because of issue with different test context and
 * session/entityManager Use same conf as {@link WSTestBase}.
 *
 * <p>
 * When replacing usage of entityManager by a repository the test seems to work,
 * either the entity manager are different (seemed to be the same though) or
 * there are something additional in the spring wrapper.
